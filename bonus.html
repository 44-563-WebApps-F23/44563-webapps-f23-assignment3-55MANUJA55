        <h3>Peeta Mellark</h3>
        <p>Peeta is repeatedly described as charming, generous, kind and likable, and possessing a self-deprecating sense of humour. He first confuses and later inspires Katniss with his determination to maintain his identity while inside the arena and his refusal to become a "piece" in the Capitol's game.</p>
